## Python script for github new commits notification.

1. This is the implementation of a python script which could send email to the user when a specific github repo is updated.
2. I use this script to monitor if the 2024-summer-internship repo is get updated. 

## Usage of the script.
1. Clone the repor to your local machine
2. Set up the .env file which contains the github app token.
3. set up python virtual environment and install all the necessary package using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. run the script using command line `python3 main.py`
5. You also could deploy the script on docker.
